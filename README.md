# REAMDE

This repository is place where all my old projects go to rest (archived) and won't clog up my profile account. Here you might find some weird stuffs or some helpful stuffs.

Most things here will not be deleted but may be if the time is right.

All pieces of code retain their licenses that is within their repository.
